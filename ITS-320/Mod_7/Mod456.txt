For Mod 4 assignment, I have changed the assignment to reflect learning loops. 
This assignments will have 2 loops instead of a psuedo do while loop. 
I have also improved the text comments to better describe what each part of the program is doing. 

Mod 5 was not altered.

Mod 6 was given an input prompt. This will help the user know what they are supposed to input.
