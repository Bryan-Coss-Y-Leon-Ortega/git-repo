    This project is teaches me how to create a html page and link JS pages to it such as console logs and alerts

console.log("Hello from the app.js file");
let a = 10; //variable a is 10

//Variable a is set to 10, 
//Console will call it behind the inspect-console page on the web browser
console.log(a);

// this is a comment

/*
Commenting in JS is the same as commenting in Java. 

I believe this only applies to the JS and not to HTML
