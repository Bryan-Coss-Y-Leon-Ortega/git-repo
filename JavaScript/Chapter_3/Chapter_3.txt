Chapter 3 will be the focus on multiple values,
This will include simple data structures like numbers and strings, but also other methods
    Array and thier properties
    Array methods
    Multidimensional Arrays
    Objects in JavaScriptWorking with objects and Arrays


Arrays and their properties
    Arrays are lists of values
    can be of all data types
    One array can contain multiple different data types

Creating Arrays
    arr1 = ["black", "White", "Yellow"]

Const array:
    Can change the value of the array, but not the value of the array itself.
        const arr = ["hi there"];
        arr[0] = "new value";
        console.log(arr[0]);
 
        arr = ["nope, now you are overwriting the array"]

        New value
        TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

Accessing Elements:
    cars = ["Toyota", "Volkswagon", "Chevy"];
    console.log(cars[0]);

Overwriting Elements:
    cars[0] = "Tesla";
    console.log(cars[0])

    Tesla

Arrays have a built in length property:

colors = ["black", "orange", "pink"]
booleans = [true, false, false, true];
emptyArray = [];

console.log("Length of colors:", colors.length);
console.log("Length of booleans:", booleans.length);
console.log("Length of empty array:", emptyArray.length);

Adding into an array:
Arrays allow the user to add into any place of the index, even if not explicitly stated.
For example, in an array of 3, it is allowed to write into position of 5 or 6,
    it will return <# empty items> at print out. 
-> Adding elements requires list.push(Item)
    Values added at the end of the array
-> Splice will add at specific values. 
    list.splice(#of items, #of how many to delete after, Items, .....);
        Seconds one will delete to the end, no matter the amount placed
->Concat
    Will add elements to the end
    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [4, 5, 6]
    list3 = list1.concat(list2)
    list3=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Deleting from array
    pop() will delete from end of array
    shift() will delete from beginning of array
    splice(...,...), parameters of where to start deleting and how many to delete
    delete list[##] will delete the item at the array and then leave as undefined. 

Finding Methods
    Check whether a value is present in an array
    arr8 = [ 2, 6, 7, 8 ];
    let findValue = arr8.find(function(e) { return e === 6});
    let findValue2 = arr8.find(e => e === 10);
    console.log(findValue, findValue2);
    Will return the correct value if found, -1 if value is not in array

    indexof() is to locate the position of the value. 
    arr8 = [ 2, 6, 7, 8 ];
    let findIndex = arr8.indexOf(6);
    let findIndex2 = arr8.indexOf(10);
    console.log(findIndex, findIndex2);
        
Sorting
    .sort() 
        -> Sort numbers from small to high
        -> Sort strings from A - Z
    
Reversing
    .reverse()
        ->Reverses the order of the array without sorting the array.

Multidimensional Arrays
    Arrays of Arrays!!!
    let arrVal1 = [1,2,3];
    let arrVal2 = [4,5,6];
    let arrVal3 = [7,8,9];

    let arrOfArrays = [arrVal1, arrVal2, arrVal3];
    let arrOfArraysOfArrays = [arrOfArrays, arrOfArrays, arrOfArrays];

Objects in JavaScript
    Have propeties and can perform actions and methods. 
    Let dog = { dogName: "Bryan",
                weight: 2.14,
                color: "Brown",
                biter: True,
            }    
    variables can be called by ["nameOfVariable"] or .nameOfVariable
    values can be changed by explicitly changing them, from string to Int, etc.    

Objects in Objects
    let dog = {items: values,  {items: values} };

Arrays in Objects
    let company = {item: value, array:[item1, item2, item3], item: value};

Objects in arrOfArrays
    let farm = [{animal: name, animal: name},{equipment: name, worker: name}]

objects in Array in Objects
    let club ={club1: name, drinks: [ shots: {drink1: tequila }] }
