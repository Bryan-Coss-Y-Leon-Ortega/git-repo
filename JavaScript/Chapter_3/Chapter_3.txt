Chapter 3 will be the focus on multiple values,
This will include simple data structures like numbers and strings, but also other methods
    Array and thier properties
    Array methods
    Multidimensional Arrays
    Objects in JavaScriptWorking with objects and Arrays


Arrays and their properties
    Arrays are lists of values
    can be of all data types
    One array can contain multiple different data types

Creating Arrays
    arr1 = ["black", "White", "Yellow"]

Const array:
    Can change the value of the array, but not the value of the array itself.
        const arr = ["hi there"];
        arr[0] = "new value";
        console.log(arr[0]);
 
        arr = ["nope, now you are overwriting the array"]

        New value
        TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

Accessing Elements:
    cars = ["Toyota", "Volkswagon", "Chevy"];
    console.log(cars[0]);

Overwriting Elements:
    cars[0] = "Tesla";
    console.log(cars[0])

    Tesla

Arrays have a built in length property:

colors = ["black", "orange", "pink"]
booleans = [true, false, false, true];
emptyArray = [];

console.log("Length of colors:", colors.length);
console.log("Length of booleans:", booleans.length);
console.log("Length of empty array:", emptyArray.length);

Adding into an array:
Arrays allow the user to add into any place of the index, even if not explicitly stated.
For example, in an array of 3, it is allowed to write into position of 5 or 6,
    it will return <# empty items> at print out.
