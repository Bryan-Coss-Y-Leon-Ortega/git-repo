This chapter will focus on classes
    Object oriented programming
    Classes and objects
    Classes
    Inheritance
    Prototypes

Class:
    Class names start with class className{ constructor(var1, var1,...)}
    All the variables are in within the class names

Constructors:
    Special method that is used to initialize objects with class

Methods:
    We can include methods in our objects

We can remove accessibility of our variables with # in front of the variables we want
class person{
    #firstName
    #lastName
    constructor(firstName, lastName){
        this.#firstName = firstName;
        this.#lastName = lastName;
    }
}
we can also modify the constructors to ensure specific validation.

Getter and Setters:
    This falls under encapsulation. This gives the user permission to change things in the data class
    while keeping variables encapsulated in the data. 

Inheritance:
