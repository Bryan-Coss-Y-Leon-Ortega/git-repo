This chapter will focus on functions and how to use them

Invoking functions:
    nameOfTheFunction();
    functionThatTakesInput("input", 5);

Functions can contain variables, this is how we take inputs.

Variables can also take contain functions:
    Look at the example below, this will allow us to rename a function 
    This will be helpful creating methods and changing names to make sense. 3

let varContainingFunctions = function(){
    let varInFunction = "I am in the function.";
    console.log("Hello from within the function", varInFunction);
}

varContainingFunctions();

Javascript is more forgiving in functions and calling them. 

Arrow Functions 
    Shorthand notation for writing and implementing an argument

    function doingStuff(x){
        console.log(x)
    }
    let DoingArrowStuff = x = console.log(x);

Spread:
    A way to put elements from an array into different operations 
    Starts with ...array
    let spread = ["so", "much", "fun"];
    let message = ["JavaScript", "is", ...spread, "and", "very", "powerful"];
        Returns: ['JavaScript', 'is', 'so', 'much', 'fun', 'and', 'very', 'powerful']

Rest Parameter:
    This will treat the function as an array, and ignore the 

    function someFunction(param1, ...param2) {
    console.log(param1, param2);
    }
    someFunction("hi", "there!", "How are you?");

Return from a function
    Similar to java, it needs a return statement and something to return
    It does not have to be a specific type
    addNumbers(para1, para2){
        return para1+para2;
    }

Returning with arrow functions
    This will be a multiline function using return

    let addTwoNumbers = (x,y) => {
        return x+y;
    }

Let vs. Var
    let is local within that function {}, const works the same
    var makes it function-scoped {} making the varibale available throughout the function

Global Variables:
    Variables declared outside any functions can be used within any functions

Immediately invoked function expression
    a way of expressing a function that involves immediately, anonymously and self-executing

Recursive Functions
    call the same function from inside the function

Nested Functions
    We can have functions within functions
    This means there is a function that is declared and called inside a function
        and only lives within the scope of that function.

Anonymous Functions 
    Functions without function name.
