In this chapter, there are discussions of loops and their uses, but because I am familiar with theses loops from java, 
    I will focus on what I do not know

For of loop
    This loop will iterate over the elements of an array
    let arr = [some array];
    for(let variableName of arr){
        //code that will be executed that will go through the array
        //variableName will be updated everytime
        //all values of array will be variableName once

    }

for in loop
    This loop will print the all values within an object
